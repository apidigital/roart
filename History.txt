==0.1.4 / 2009-08-19
Implemented callbacks, you can now hook into the ticket life-cycle with before and after create and update.
Saving works like ActiveRecord now, with save returning true if successful and false otherwise, and save! raising an error if unsuccessful.
Creating tickets is more ActiveRecord like now, with new not saving to the ticketing system automatically, you must call save or save!. There is a create function to do this now. Although this does break backward compatability, I'm not going to bump the minor because a) nobody has forked this yet, and b) i skipped 0.
You can now specify a default queue when you subclass Roart::Ticket. just add a default_queue 'queue name' to your class and that queue will automatically be searched unless you specify a queue.

==0.1.3 / 2009-08-18
Can now update tickets with #save. Returns true if saved, raises an error if not.

==0.1.2 / 2009-08-18
Added Create ticket functionality. Ticket.new will create a ticket in the RT system and return that ticket.

== 0.1.1 / 2009-08-17
Added History functionality. #histories now loads an array of history objects into memory and you can access them like you would a regular array. A few connivence methods (last, count) have also been added.

== 0.1.0 / 2009-08-13
Initial Commit. Base functionality added. Can search for tickets, and see all info on tickets. Ticket History not yet implemented.
